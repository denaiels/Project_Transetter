**Description:**

Transetter is my final project for the Software Engineering course in my Semester 4 of Computer Science Major at BINUS University.

Transetter is an application that focuses on transportation. Transetter is an application that has a unique feature that other transportation apps don’t have, that is, Transetter can order multiple means of transportation to get the user to the destination that they want. Usually, a transportation app, mainly the ride ordering apps, only provide one mean of transportation from location to the destination, such as Gojek where to get from point A to point B users can only choose 1 mean of transportation, either it is Go-Ride or Go-Car. Transetter gives its users the opportunity to choose multiple means of transportation to get from point A to point B, C, D, etc. For example, if you want to go from point A to point Z, then after setting the location and destination on the app, the app will provide choices for the users to choose. The choices are the routes that will be taken by the user. On every route choice, there can be multiple means of transportation and multiple stops before reaching the final destination, and there will also be the details on distance, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and price. An example of the simple choices from point A to destination point Z is as follows:

Choice 1 : Distance 3.8 km, ETA: 13 minutes, Total price Rp25.000,-

•	Point A to Point Z (using Gojek, Rp25.000,-)

Choice 2 : Distance 4.5 km, ETA: 30 minutes, Total price Rp13.500,-

•	Point A to Bus Stop B (using Transjakarta, Rp3.500)

•	Bus Stop B to Point Z (using Gojek, Rp10.000,-)

Users can choose between using 1 mean of transportation and faster but more expensive, or using 2 means of transportation that is cheaper, but longer on the way. This is the unique feature that Transetter provides for its users. This app not only provides those choices to guide the users, but users can also book the orders through the app itself, except for a few vendors that have their own app, then Transetter will automatically redirect the user to the app related. This makes Transetter unique and very much helpful for users.
